# js-understanding--This-
## Conceptual Overview of "this"
When a function is created, a keyword called this is created (behind the scenes), which links to the object in which the function operates.

The this keywordâ€™s value has nothing to do with the function itself, how the function is called determines this's value

Default "this" context
// define a function
var myFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};

// call it
myFunction();
